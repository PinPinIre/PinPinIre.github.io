I'm currently a 4th year computer science student in Trinity College Dublin.

In the past I have worked for a large software company in the insurance sector and a small education startup based in Dublin. Both were completely different but I learned a lot about web development and have found new areas that interest me.

While working for the startup I had to implement a basic recommendation system for notes. For this particular project I read [Programming Collective Intelligence](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do) and have since had a fascination with machine learning, AI and genetic algorithms.

Other technical things that interest me include; functional programming, computer vision, wearable devices, graph-theory, concurrency, compilers, and software engineering practices.

I really don't have much free time lately but I used to be an avid reader. Lately I have an developed an interest in books relating to 18th century history and economics. If you are interested you can follow my reading habits on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/pinpinire)
