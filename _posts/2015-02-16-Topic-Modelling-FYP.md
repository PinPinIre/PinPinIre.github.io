title: Final Year Project - Topic Modelling
---
Some background information is needed before I begin. At the moment I am currently in my final year of Computer Science in Trinity College Dublin. It's been a long but an amazing 4 years. In that time I have learned so much but more importantly I have also learned that there is much more I don't know yet. To those unfamiliar with the Computer Science course in Trinity College, it diverges in the second semester of 4th year. You have the option of taking a nine month internship and then return to pursue a masters degree for a year or you can stay for the final semester and undertake a research project in an area that interests you. I chose the latter.

Since early January I have been working on my final year project on the performance of topic modelling algorithms. Topic modelling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that tries to discover the latent or hidden topics in a set of documents. Traditional search methods rely on an index built up of words found within a document. If for example you wanted to search for documents related "Erlang" most search tools would only return results for pages which explicitly mention Erlang. Perhaps you didn't really want documents related to just Erlang. Maybe you were actually interested in documents related to concurrency, functional programming, Joe Armstrong, Prolog, languages run in VM's, etc.

Topic models on the other hand uses statistical techniques to find the hidden meaning in a document. Finding these hidden topics can then help us to find other related documents, even if they don't explicitly mention the topic of interest. When you consider the increasing amount of data released each day, hopefully these techniques will become more prominent when categorising research papers, analysing tweets, indexing articles, etc.

In my next post I am going to compile a list of some the resources I have found over the past few months related to machine learning, topic modelling, artificial neural networks, deep learning, statistics etc. The post is mainly going to be a place where I can keep track of everything I have read and used but hopefully it might help other people who have a similar interests to me.
