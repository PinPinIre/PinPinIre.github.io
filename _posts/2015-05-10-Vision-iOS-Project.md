title: Vision and iOS project
---
I decided last week that I wanted to do three things this summer:

* make a serious attempt at iOS development,
* do something related to computer vision,
* and improve my Ruby.

I hope to use this post to track my progress and to post any resources that I use along the way. If anyone has any tips, please send them to [@_Kotl](https://twitter.com/_Kotl) on twitter.

I briefly looked at iOS development last summer during my internship so I have a rough idea where to start with this.
I was following the Stanford iOS 7 course on iTunes U before I went back to university. Since then Apple have released Swift and the [course](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-8-apps-swift/id961180099) has been updated. I may go back to the iOS 7 course and then quickly go through the new Swift version. I quite enjoyed Objective-C when I was using it, so this would be the main reason why I would go with the older course.

I took an introductory computer vision module last semester and I think it was probably the best module I did over the past 4 years.
The course was taught by Dr. Kenneth Dawson-Howe (KDH) and closely followed his book, [A Practical Introduction to Computer Vision with OpenCV](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1118848454). Some of the topics covered included colour-spaces, image pre-processing, motion-detection, image-transformations, edge-detection, statistical pattern recognition and image histograms.
I am less sure now how to improve my understanding of computer vision but this will probably be heavily influenced by the project I choose.

I haven't used Ruby much over the past 4 years but I have read Russ Olsen's [Design Patterns in Ruby](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0321490452) and made a stab at Michael Hartl's [Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org) a few years ago. At the moment I would consider Python to be my strongest language so I want to focus on Ruby to diversify my skill-set. Depending on the project I choose I may need to interface with some backend. If that's the case I may decide to use Sinatra or Rails for the api backend.

I haven't decided exactly what I want to build yet but I do have some vague half-formed ideas revolving around landmark recognition and lifelogging. For the moment I am going to focus on building up my knowledge of iOS development and then see how to do computer vision stuff on iOS. I'll try to keep this post updated with what I discover along the way.
