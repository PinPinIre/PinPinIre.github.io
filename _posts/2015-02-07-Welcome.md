I finally got around to setting up this website. I think it only took me two years to do in the end. Every few months I would start to work on it but never really knew what to do until now.

Recently I began to work on my final year project for the computer science course in Trinity College Dublin and have found some really cool things that I'd like to keep in one place and share with other people. So expect a post in the coming days related to some of the Machine Learning/Topic Modelling resources I have found over the past while.

In the past I have used Medium for blog posts and I will continue to do so. I will be using this site for my more technical posts. I also really love using Medium for writing and while Jekyll is nice, it can't compete with what Medium has to offer.

You can also follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_Kotl) if you can't wait for my next post.
