title: My Favorite CS Books!
---
On Wednesday, 22nd April 2015, I handed in the report for my final year project. This was the last piece of work to be submitted as part of my degree and signaled the end of my time as an undergraduate. At the moment, I am in the limbo period of not technically being a graduate (a graduand is perhaps the correct phrase?).

This newfound freedom has encouraged me to write about some of the computer science books I have read and been influenced by over the past 4 years.

#### The Design of Everyday Things

##### by Donald Norman
I would consider Design of Everyday Things (DoET) to be a must read for anyone involved in technology or design. DoET was one the seminal texts on UX and remains relevant even today. This is a book that was designed to be read by anyone. Don uses clear analogies to explain the problems with the design of everyday objects, such as door handles, and how they can affect the user.

If you are involved in the design of any product, that will be used by humans, you should read this book. DoET can help make you aware of the user and potential problems that they may face when making your design design decisions.

#### Inside the Machine

##### by Jon Stokes
Like many computer science undergrads I tried to read Hennessy and Patterson. I really did try but H&P can be quite dry and dull. H&P has been the staple of courses in computer architecture since the late 70's but it is a literal tome. The accessibility of H&P leaves much to be desired.

This is why I like Inside the Machine (ItM). ItM was written by a co-founder of Ars Technica and it doesn't try to be a hardcore computer science textbook. The content in ItM is very accessible and could probably be easily understood by anyone with a basic knowledge of computers. I would probably even describe ItM as being the computer science equivalent of a popular science book. ItM is a must read for anyone interested in computer architecture but are put off by the stalwart texts.


#### Design Patterns in Ruby
![alt text](http://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/0321490452-M.jpg "Design Patterns in Ruby cover")
##### by Russ Olsen
I orignally read Design Patterns in Ruby for two reasons: to introduce myself to Ruby and to learn about design patterns. While Olsen doesn't cover all of the Gang of Four design patterns, he covers those that he felt were relevant to Ruby and introduces some news ones that were.

I feel this is a great book for anyone interested in learning a little bit about Ruby or design patterns. Olsen is very clear in his descriptions and uses clear analogies whenever possible. I would consider this to be one of the best technical books I have ever read.


#### Code

##### by Charles Petzold
I'm not quite sure how to describe Code. Is it a book about history, programming, maths, computer archictecture? 


#### The Mythical Man Month

#### Programming Collective Intelligence

#### Real World Haskell
